# deep-learning-challenge

Overview

The Alphabet Soup project involves building a machine learning model to predict whether an applicant organization will be successful if funded by the Alphabet Soup nonprofit foundation. The dataset contains historical application data for over 34,000 organizations that have received funding, and we use this data to create a binary classifier. The classifier will predict if an applicant will be successful in utilizing the funding.
Problem Statement:

Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team needs a tool that can assist them in selecting the applicants with the best chance of success. The goal is to create a deep learning model that predicts the likelihood of success based on various attributes provided in the dataset.
